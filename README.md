# Dear Yaniv,

### I wanted to try and learn this technology called NEST.JS, which is heavily inspired by Angular.

### My implementation of the project is a bit different from the requirements,

### but thanks to what we've learned in the class,

### I was able to quickly understand and use complex techniques, like Dependancy Injection, and a bit of Reactive Programming.

I hope this is something you can accept.

I also created another implementation using Express and JavaScript in case you prefer it.

Thank you, Roy.
